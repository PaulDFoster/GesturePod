GesturePod 
==========

GesturePod is a plug-and-play, gesture recognition device that is designed to be clamped onto
any white-cane used by persons with Visually Impairment. Once clamped onto the cane firmly, 
simple and natural gestures performed on the cane can be used to interact with various devices,
for instance a mobile phone. Watch the [GesturePod video here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjDloPaG_l0Et7Ikid1voOVFuI116Q).

In this directory, we provide resources for
  1. Running the gesture recognition pipeline on the [Arduino MKR1000](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr1000), in the `onMKR1000` directory, and
  2. Running the gesture recognition pipeline on your computer in the `onComputer` directory.
  3. The pipeline to a) collect data, b) label the data, and c) extract features  is available in the `training` directory.
